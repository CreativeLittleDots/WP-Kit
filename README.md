## Discontinued

This repo is being discontinued to make way for [```Themosis```](http://framework.themosis.com/) Framework. 

It is discontinued in the sense that there will be no further feature updates on the repo but it will continue to be supported in terms of bug fixes and minor improvements.

Themosis Framework works as a framework for Wordpress Themes and Plugins which makes this repo redundant.
