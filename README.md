You should use ```Themosis``` or ```Assely``` is you require any handling of following:

* Routes
* Middleware
* Authentication 
* Metaboxes
* Custom Fields

If you do not need these features then ```wp-kit/theme``` could be for you comes packaged with several ```Themosis``` and ```Assely``` features such as:

* ServiceProvider Config
* PostType Registration
* Taxonomy Registration
* Invoke Controllers on Conditions
* View Handling
