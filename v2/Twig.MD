# wp-kit/theme 2.0

Welcome to Twig & Views guide for wp-kit/theme 2.0.

The view structure in wp-kit is based on how Themosis implements [Twig](https://framework.themosis.com/docs/1.3/twig/) and [Views](https://framework.themosis.com/docs/1.3/views/).

You are able to use Twig, and plain vanilla PhP files for views. Blade is not supported at the moment.

By default, views are stored in the `resources/views` directory of your wp-kit theme.
