# wp-kit/theme 2.0

Welcome to the Twig & Views guide for wp-kit. The view structure in wp-kit is based on how Themosis implements [Twig](https://framework.themosis.com/docs/1.3/twig/) and [Views](https://framework.themosis.com/docs/1.3/views/).

You are able to use Twig, and plain PhP files for views. Blade is not supported at the moment.

Views are registered through the use of a Views Finder class. By default, views are stored in the `resources/views` directory of your wp-kit theme.
