# wp-kit/theme 2.0

Welcome to Service Providers guide for wp-kit/theme 2.0.

The way Service Providers work in wp-kit is exactly the same as in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/providers).

Service Providers should extend the `Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider` class directly and should reside in `resources/providers` in you wp-kit theme.
