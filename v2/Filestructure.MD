# wp-kit

Welcome to the guide on filestructure in wp-kit.

The filestructure is very much influenced by [Themosis` filestructure](https://framework.themosis.com/docs/1.3/theme/#structure) where the resources folder holds the core components.

```php
+-- resources/
|   +-- admin/
|   +-- config/
|   +-- controllers/
|   +-- models/
|   +-- providers/
|   +-- views/
|   +-- widgets/
|   +-- routes.php
+-- functions.php
```
